## Deployment

I have deployed the website on Render and am currently in the process of further developing the project by implementing additional features and optimizing the code. While there are a few small bugs that I am actively addressing, the project remains a work in progress. Once development is complete, I plan to deploy it on AWS EC2. In the meantime, the current version is deployed on Render.
